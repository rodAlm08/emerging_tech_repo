# Emerging Technologies Assessment Repository

Rodrigo Almeida - G00377123

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the Emerging Technologies course assignments and projects. It contains detailed Jupyter notebooks which demonstrate my comprehension and application of emerging technologies, with emphasis on quantum computing.

## Repository Structure

### .gitignore: 
A configuration file ensuring that temporary files and folders not essential for version control are ignored.

### tasks.ipynb: 
In this notebook, you will find my solutions to the tasks associated with each covered topic. These solutions have been completed promptly after each topic was introduced in class.

### project.ipynb: 
This notebook explores Deutsch's Algorithm, presenting the problem, explaining the algorithm using a mix of Markdown, LaTeX notation, tables, and plots, and demonstrating the implementation of the algorithm using Qiskit, including necessary oracle circuits. The efficacy of the algorithm will be validated through simulation.

# Getting started

# Quantum Computing and Emerging Technologies 
Assessment Repository
by Rodrigo Almeida - G00377123

## Repository Structure
This file provides a summary of the repository's purpose, contents, and instructions for cloning and running the code/notebooks.

### .gitignore: 
A configuration file ensuring that temporary files and folders not essential for version control are ignored.

### tasks.ipynb: 
In this notebook, you will find my solutions to the tasks associated with each covered topic. These solutions have been completed promptly after each topic was introduced in class.

### project.ipynb: 
This notebook explores Deutsch's Algorithm, presenting the problem, explaining the algorithm using a mix of Markdown, LaTeX notation, tables, and plots, and demonstrating the implementation of the algorithm using Qiskit, including necessary oracle circuits. The efficacy of the algorithm will be validated through simulation.
